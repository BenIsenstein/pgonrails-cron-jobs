# pgonrails-cron-jobs

This is a set of cron jobs which help keep PG On Rails up-to-date with the official Supabase self-hosting example. It is a top priority to maintain complete feature parity between PG On Rails and the official self-hosting method.

Jobs:
- Update Docker image versions via PR
- Notify me when work has been committed in `/docker` in the offical repo
